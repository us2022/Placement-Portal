# Placement-Portal
The Training and Placement cell of a college has to keep brainstorming all the year so that they can attract more companies to their campuses. Some of their strategies include cold calls, getting the alumni of their college to get some connections, using Linkedin to get in touch with various HR personnels, creating brochures showcasing their previous placement or academic records. This is quite a tedious and time-consuming approach as even after executing them in full-measure, companies might be very late in responding to them. This is a major challenge faced widely by Training and Placement Officers. On the other hand it is a whole challenge for a company to properly screen and interview each candidate that comes through, to fill their talent pipeline. Recruiting teams struggle big time to efficiently reach out and engage all the candidates present in the recruitment drive. Other than the obvious time crunch and less manpower, the recruiters are reluctant to reach out to a larger audience due to the cost associated with recruiting at a distance is pretty high. This is no secret that in a campus or university recruitment drive thousands of candidates are supposed to be screened. Screening candidates in a day is tiring and exhausting for companies. This not only increases the burden for the campus recruiters but also the organization as a whole.
